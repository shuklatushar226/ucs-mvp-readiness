"""Per-connector implemented-flow extraction from UCS Rust source.

This is the ground truth for "does connector X implement flow Y". It exists
because none of the obvious alternatives is correct:

  - data/field_probe/*.json records whether a request could be BUILT, not what
    is implemented. It disagrees with source on ~130 cells; truelayer's Void
    reads not_implemented while the Rust plainly implements it.
  - connector_specs/*/specs.json is curated and can over-claim: CI's
    check_connector_specs asserts only flows subset-of supported_suites, never
    the reverse, so under-declaration is invisible (worldpayxml is missing
    PreAuthenticate today).
  - `cargo expand` / rustc trait enumeration is WORSE than source text:
    macro_connector_flow_status_impls! emits real ConnectorIntegrationV2 impls
    for every stub across the whole fleet, so the compiler's view is
    saturated with NotImplemented.

The algorithm is check_connector_specs.rs:172-246 with its three known defects
fixed (see FIXES below).
